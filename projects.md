# Projects at AACtelier

Our vision is to improve participation of people with disabilities in social conversation and in the design process of technology by: (1) expanding on social science theory to create new design frameworks, (2) innovating accessible co-design practices, and (3) developing affordable, accessible technology that fosters new forms of interaction.
