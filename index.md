# Introducing the AACtelier lab


The AACtelier is an interdisciplinary research lab at the University of Maryland that seeks to advance human agency through design. The ***AAC*** in AACtelier alludes to one of our main threads of research: Augmentative and Alternative Communication, and also represents the values that shape our research: Agency, Accessibility and Collaboration.  We study and create new technologies for people with disabilities and diverse communication styles to further our understanding of social interaction and user agency and to propose new accessible designs. We also create and develop interfaces and tools by inviting end users and interdisciplinary stakeholders to build and design together. By drawing from engineering, design, communication, behavioral and social science to study how assistive tools are used in context and where they fall short.
